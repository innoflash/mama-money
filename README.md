## 3rd party libraries used
- [Moment](https://momentjs.com/): I used it for handling of dates on the app

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```Found working with RxJS more exciting as usual. :)```
